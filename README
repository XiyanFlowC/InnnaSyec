# InnnaSyec
A reversing tool for mips r5900 (Emotion Engine, aka. TX79).

This tool is able to patch an ELF partically.

## Build
Firstly, you need to build simpgen:
'''
cl simpgen.cpp /utf-8 /O2 # Windows
g++ simpgen.cpp -o simpgen -O2
'''
Known bug: the stupid MSVC will make the program failed
and I have no idea what's the diff. So, my suggest is using g++.

Then, you should build mips5900 description include files.
'''
simpgen -i mips5900.cpp -o mips5900
'''

After that, you can compile the program:
'''
cl r5900.cpp /c /O2 /utf-8
cl prtasm.cpp /c /O2 /utf-8
link prtasm.obj r5900.obj
'''
